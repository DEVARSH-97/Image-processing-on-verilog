# Image-processing-on-verilog

This repository contains the project for real-time image processing using an FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array), a collaborative effort led by Techevince/Electronics Club, finalized in April 2024. The project showcases the implementation of real-time image storage and blurring algorithms directly on FPGA hardware, along with a UART interface for efficient pixel data transfer from a computer to the FPGA.

Features

Real-Time Image Storage: Leveraging the FPGA's capabilities for rapid data processing to store images in real-time.

Image Blurring Algorithm: Implemented a sophisticated algorithm for image blurring, demonstrating the FPGA's potential in executing image processing tasks.

UART Communication: Developed a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) interface to facilitate the smooth transfer of pixel data between a computer and the FPGA, ensuring a seamless workflow for image processing tasks.
